# Summary
This project is an application for	Linked	Lists,	in which you will implement	a	large	integer calculator. Performing	arithmetic on	very	large	 numbers (i.e.,	 numbers	 with	 a	 large	 number	 of	 digits)

# Specifications
This program should	perform addition,	subtraction,	multiplication,	and	division	on	arbitrarily	large	integers.	Each	integer	is	represented	as a	list of	its digits. Implement the	multiplication	as	a	standard	multiplication	where	the	first multiplicand is	multiplied with each digit of	the	second	multiplicand	and	then	added.	As	for	division,	you	have	to implement	it	as	a	long	division.
and it should	read	a	file	containing	at	least two	numbers	to	perform the	operations	above. The	user	should	be	able	 to	select	 the	operations	 (s)he	wants	 to	perform through	a	proper menu	with	 the	options	necessary	to	run	the functionalities	of	the	program
